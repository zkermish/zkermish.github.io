A work day at LDB starts with the ~45 minute drive from McMurdo after breakfast. Shuttles are run throughout the day using vans, but the majority of folk at LDB take the 7:30 ride, which uses the larger capacity Kress or "Ivan the Terrabus." We've also had rides on the old school Delta transports, which provide a bumpier ride.

        <figcaption>Getting dropped of back in town after a ride in the Kress.  While the Kress is an impressive vehicle, riding in the back cabin is probably my least favorite way to get out to LDB.  The windows are too high too look out, the cabin isn't heated, and the seats aren't that comfy.  However, in the front cabin, seats at proper window height for an amazing view and the spring-loaded seats make for an enjoyable, bouncy ride.  Not sure I'd enjoy the ride as much on a morning drive out when I'm trying to nap.</figcaption>

LDB camp itself consists of several heated buildings to support the research payloads, the CSBF instrumentation and in-flight communication, as well as facilities for the necessities in life (eating and digestion).

COSI (which is flying the first super-pressure ballon science payload) is having a weather port built for them all the way on the left of the photo.  You can also see the communications antennas and the CSBF building on the right of the photo.</figcaption>

Work within the highbay isn't that different than work back in Princeton or in Texas, aside from the fact that the highbay is *really nice*; this is by far the best high bay / lab space I've had the pleasure of working in. However, it can get pretty crowded with all the parallel projects that need to be completed to prepare for integration.

We've so far only been opening the high bay doors to get some cargo in and out and to set the crane up outside for some hardware tests.  We'll be opening them more later in the campaign once the experiment is integrated and we need to take the payload outside for compatibility tests.  When the doors are open, the entire highbay quickly cools down to the temperature outside.  Luckily, it hasn't been that cold yet; I only need to grab my jacket if the doors are open more than ~30 seconds.
