This has been an eventful week for SPIDER, myself, and LDB overall.  The first launch of the season happened this Thursday, with a beautiful launch of the ANITA instrument. The shuttle schedules and my shift schedule made it so I wasn't at LDB during launch myself, but many of my colleagues were there and able to get some excellent photos. See the animated gif below I made from John Ruhl's photos.

The next morning, I took part in a video chat with the 3rd grade classes of <a href ="http://www.hoover.pausd.org">Hoover Elementary</a> in Palo Alto, CA. Thanks to my friend <a href ="https://twitter.com/MsElsaChen">Ms. Elsa Chen</a> for setting it up. The students had some excellent questions and seemed pretty excited when I showed them our telescope and the view of Mt. Erebus outside our door. I had a great time talking to them and I hope they enjoyed learning a little bit about our work and research life in Antarctica.

 Since one of the students asked how long it takes me to get to the lab, I figured I should post a video I made a while back of the drive out to LDB (condensed from the 45 minute drive to a 3 minute time-lapse video).

SPIDER also made some great strides to near flight readiness this week. We installed our 'wall of power,' a four by six array of light-weight solar panels that will keep our batteries charged in flight. We then rolled the instrument outside to test the solar panel array throughput and looked at the Antarctic sky for the first time through our telescopes. Of course, with all that progress on integrating the systems, we discovered yet more issues and bugs to fix, but that's to be expected. We're making lots of progress on all the issues we've uncovered, so we're hoping to be on schedule for a launch soon enough!

This was also the first time this campaign we've had all 6 telescope apertures open to the room, in preparation for looking at the Antarctic sky. We usually close them off with curved metal plates to reflect light back into the telescopes for lower loading and to shield the detectors from radio-frequency interference (RFI) found in the room. </figcaption>
