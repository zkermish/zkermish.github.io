My name is Zigmund Kermish (but everyone calls me Ziggy). Things that I love:

- My super-cool wife, [Janine](http://janineyoong.com)
- Food
- Building cool things for science


Iâ€™m currently a [Dicke postdoctoral fellow](http://www.princeton.edu/physics/about/employment/pfep/) in experimental physics at Princeton University. While I work in Princeton, NJ, I live in New York City, so I've experienced the wonders of NJTransit and Penn Station at various hours of the day. 

Before arriving at Princeton, I was a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. While a graduate student, I lived in San Francisco so I could experience the wonders of BART at various hours of the day (sensing a theme?). 

Checkout the [research](/research) section of my page to learn more about what I do.
